# Educational and Fun Machine Learning Project

## Overview

In this project, my college friends and I explored various machine-learning techniques. We experimented with different supervised algorithms, feature engineering, and cross-validation methods.

## Highlights

- **Supervised Algorithms**: Tested multiple algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering**: Experimented with Scaling methods and Feature Selection.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used different methods for robust evaluation.

## Interactive Notebook

Check out our shareable Google Colab notebook, packed with code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Personal Note

As a student aiming for my first job, this project showcases my passion for machine learning. Enjoy! üç∑
